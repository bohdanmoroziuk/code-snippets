# State Management

## Managing application state

1. Share state between components by lifting it up to the lowest common ancestor;
2. Use an external **Stateful Service** and allow components to consume state
directly;
3. Use **Composition API** to create reusable composables and external reactive
state to allow components to consume state directly;
4. Use **State Provider** pattern to provide state to the whole application or
only specific component tree;
5. Use state management library like **Vuex** or **Pinia**.
