# Atomic commits

An “atomic” change revolves around one task or one fix.

## Atomic approach

- Commit each fix or task as a separate change
- Only commit when a block of work is complete
- Commit each layout change separately
- Joint commit for layout file, code behind file, and additional resources


## Benefits

- Easy to roll back without affecting other changes
- Easy to make other changes on the fly
- Easy to merge features to other branches
