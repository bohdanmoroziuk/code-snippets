- Crawl

This is the process used by search engines that involves sending a bot to your website to gather information on pages that exist and no longer exist and update their database on the information it has gathered. It is necessary to get indexed by search engines and get found.

A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of a web browser loading entire new pages. The goal is faster transitions that make the website feel more like a native app.

In a SPA, a page refresh never occurs; instead, all necessary HTML, JavaScript, and CSS code is either retrieved by the browser with a single page load, or the appropriate resources are dynamically loaded and added to the page as necessary, usually in response to user actions.

- **SSG**

A static site generator is a software application that creates HTML pages from templates or components and a given content source.

- **SSR**

Server-side rendering refers to an application’s ability to display the web-page on the server rather than rendering it in the browser. When a website’s JavaScript is rendered on the website’s server, a fully rendered page is sent to the client and the client’s JavaScript bundle engages and enables the Single Page Application framework to operate.

- **Hydration**

Hydration is the process of using client-side JavaScript to add application state and interactivity to server-rendered HTML.

- **Tree-shaking**

Tree shaking is a term commonly used within a JavaScript context to describe the removal of dead code.
It relies on the ``import`` and ``export`` statements to detect if code modules are exported and imported for use between JavaScript files.

In modern JavaScript applications, we use module bundlers to automatically remove dead code when bundling multiple JavaScript files into single files. This is important for preparing code that is production ready, for example with clean structures and minimal file size.

- **URL**

A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a unique identifier used to locate a resource on the Internet. It is also referred to as a web address. URLs consist of multiple parts -- including a protocol and domain name -- that tell a web browser how and where to retrieve a resource.
