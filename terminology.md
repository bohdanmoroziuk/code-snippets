# Front-end terminology

- **DevTools**

Short for developer tools. Usually refers to the developer tools of browsers like Firefox or Chrome, but could also refer to devtool extensions for frameworks (React, Vue).

- **Accessibility** (a11y)

Best practices for keeping a website accessible for people with any kind of disability. The acronym comes from the fact that there is 11 letters between a and y in accessibility.

- **Internationalization** (i18n)

Best practices for enabling a site to be adapted to any culture (language etc). The acronym comes from the fact that there is 18 letters between i and n in internationalization.

- **Localization** (l10n)

The act of adapting a site to a specific culture. For example translating texts, formatting numbers etc. The acronym comes from the fact that there is 10 letters between l and n in localization.

- **Client side**

Code run on the client, for example in a users browser.

- **Server side**

Code run on a server.

- **Environment variable**

Variables set on the environment in which the “app” is deployed.

- **User Agent**

A string indicating what web browser that is used.

- **CMS**

Content Management System. A system that helps users manage the content of a website, for example Wordpress or Contentful.

- **SEO**

Search Engine Optimization. Practices for optimizing a websites ranking in search engines such as Google.

- **CRUD**

Short for Create, Read, Update, Delete. Used to describe the basic operations of persistent storage. Sometimes also refers to simple websites where all you can do is these actions.

- **UI**

User Interface. All the things you see on a web page.

- **UX** (User Experience)

How users interact with a web site but also how the web site affects user.

- **Bug**

An error, a flaw, a fault. Something that doesn’t work. The worlds first computer bug is reported to have been an actual bug.

- **Sitemap**

A document used by search engine bots to find all the pages on your site.

- **SPA**

A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of a web browser loading entire new pages. The goal is faster transitions that make the website feel more like a native app.

In a SPA, a page refresh never occurs; instead, all necessary HTML, JavaScript, and CSS code is either retrieved by the browser with a single page load, or the appropriate resources are dynamically loaded and added to the page as necessary, usually in response to user actions.

- **SSG**

A static site generator is a software application that creates HTML pages from templates or components and a given content source.

- **SSR**

Server-side rendering refers to an application’s ability to display the web-page on the server rather than rendering it in the browser. When a website’s JavaScript is rendered on the website’s server, a fully rendered page is sent to the client and the client’s JavaScript bundle engages and enables the Single Page Application framework to operate.

- **Hydration**

Hydration is the process of using client-side JavaScript to add application state and interactivity to server-rendered HTML.

- **Tree-shaking**

Tree shaking is a term commonly used within a JavaScript context to describe the removal of dead code.
It relies on the ``import`` and ``export`` statements to detect if code modules are exported and imported for use between JavaScript files.

In modern JavaScript applications, we use module bundlers to automatically remove dead code when bundling multiple JavaScript files into single files. This is important for preparing code that is production ready, for example with clean structures and minimal file size.

- **URL**

A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a unique identifier used to locate a resource on the Internet. It is also referred to as a web address. URLs consist of multiple parts -- including a protocol and domain name -- that tell a web browser how and where to retrieve a resource.

End users use URLs by typing them directly into the address bar of a browser or by clicking a hyperlink found on a webpage, bookmark list, in an email or from another application.

- **URI**

A Universal Resource Identifier (URI) is a member of this universal set of names in registered name spaces and addresses referring to registered protocols or name spaces.

- **URL** vs. **URI**

URI identifies a resource and differentiates it from others by using a name, location, or both. URL identifies the web address or location of a unique resource. URI contains components like a scheme, authority, path, and query. URL has similar components to a URI, but its authority consists of a domain name and port.

- **CLI**

A command-line interface (CLI) is a text-based user interface (UI) used to run programs, manage computer files and interact with the computer. Command-line interfaces are also called command-line user interfaces, console user interfaces and character user interfaces. CLIs accept as input commands that are entered by keyboard; the commands invoked at the command prompt are then run by the computer.

- **IDE**

An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger.

- **Framework**

A web framework (WF) or web application framework (WAF) is a software framework that is designed to support the development of web applications including web services, web resources, and web APIs. Web frameworks provide a standard way to build and deploy web applications on the World Wide Web. Web frameworks aim to automate the overhead associated with common activities performed in web development.

- **Sitemap**

A document used by search engine bots to find all the pages on your site.

- **robots.txt**

Robots.txt is a text file webmasters create to instruct web robots (typically search engine robots) how to crawl pages on their website. The robots.txt file is part of the the robots exclusion protocol (REP), a group of web standards that regulate how robots crawl the web, access and index content, and serve that content up to users.
